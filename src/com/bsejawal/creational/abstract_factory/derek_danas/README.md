# Abstract Factory Method
### What is Abstract Factory Pattern?
    - It is like a factory, but everything is encapsulated
    - The method that orders the object
    - The factories that build the object
    - The final objects
    - The final objects contain objects that use the Strategy Pattern
    - Composition: Object class fields are objects 
### What can you do with an Abstract Factory?
    - Allows you to create families of related objects without specifying a concrete class
    - Use when you have many objects that can be added, or changed dynamically during runtime
    - You can model anything you can imagine and have those object interact through common interfaces
    - The Bad: Things can get complicated
